	abstract = {{GENIUSv}2 is a discrete-facilities/discrete-materials nuclear fuel cycle systems analysis tool currently under development at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. It is designed not only to compute the capacity and mass flow data produced by other study tools but also to model the complex relationships between nuclear fuel cycle facilities; the institutions that own them; and the national, intranational, and/or transnational regions in which they operate. This paper describes novel modeling capabilities and methodological contributions present in {GENIUSv}2, including its treatment of the region-institution-facility hierarchy and its optimization-compatible framework. We then present a number of test problems designed to demonstrate the code’s ability to closely reproduce results from another study tool (Idaho National Laboratory’s {VISION} code) and to richly model multi-region scenarios not easily captured by the data models of other codes currently available.},

	title = {An Integrated Used Fuel Disposition And Generic Repository Model},
	abstract = {As the United States Department of Energy ({DOE}) simultaneously considers alternative
fuel cycles and waste disposal options, an integrated fuel cycle and generic disposal
system analysis tool is increasingly necessary for informing domestic nuclear spent fuel
policy. A generic repository model capabable of illuminating the distinct dominant
physics of candidate repository lithologies, designs, and engineering components will
provide an interface between the Used Fuel Disposition ({UFD}) and Fuel Cycle Options
({FCO}) Campaign goals. Repository metrics such as necessary repository footprint and
peak annual dose are aﬀected by heat and radionuclide release characteristics speciﬁc to
variable spent fuel compositions associated with alternative fuel cycles. Computational
tools capable of simulating the dynamic, heterogeneous spent fuel isotopics resulting
from transition scenarios and alternative fuel cycles are, however, lacking in repository
modeling options. This work proposes to construct such a generic repository model
appropriate for systems analysis. By emphasizing modularity and speed, the work at
hand seeks to provide a tool which captures the dominant physics of detailed repository
analysis within the {UFD} Campaign and can be robustly and ﬂexibly integrated within
the Cyclus fuel cycle simulation tool.},

	abstract = {The characteristics of a Lead Slowing-Down Spectrometer ({LSDS}) installed at the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center ({LANSCE}) are presented in this paper. This instrument is designed to study neutron-induced fission on ultra small quantities of actinides, on the order of tens of nanograms or less. The measurements of the energy-time relation, energy resolution and neutron flux are compared to simulations performed with {MCNPX}. Results on neutron-induced fission of 235U and
239Pu with tens of micrograms and tens of nanograms,
respectively, are presented. Finally, a digital filter designed to improve the detection of fission events at short time after the proton pulses is described.},
